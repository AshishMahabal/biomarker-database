TBS 3.3.0-beta-12

New features:
* Parameter ope=nif  (name may change): ope=nif:xxx <=> if [val]='xxx';then '';.
  This is a shortcut.
* Parameter ope=minv (name can change): turn the value to '' not but for parameter 'magnet'.
  This enables you to have a magnet fields which will be always invisible. 

Enhancements:
* Paremeters 'headergrp','parentgrp','footergrp' work for any kind of data source (array, object, ...)
  and also with sub items. Can can also use the virtual columns # and $.
  Example : [blk;block=tr;headergrp=#] or [blk;block=tr;headergrp=ident.name]


TBS 3.3.0-beta-06

New features:
* LoadTemplate('',$charset) set the charset without changing the current template.
  This enables you for example to load a template from a string and then set the relevant chartset.
* New plug-in event: OnMergeGroup. It occurs when a header, a footer or a splitter is merged.

Enhancements:
* Fields in the conditional clause of a section are also cached.
* Templates and subtemplates are also searched in include_path.
* Custom functions for LoadTemplate support a new argument to process newline characters. 
* MergeField('onload') also merges variable fields such as [onload.x].
* MergeBlock('blk','cond') also merges var fields such as [blk.x] and [blk;file=...] just like [onload] and [onshow] do.

Fixed bugs:
* Wrong merging when a block is using parameter "p1" and having a field outside the block.
  See http://www.tinybutstrong.com/forum.php?msg_id=7804
* Now [var..now] uses time() instead of mktime().
  See http://www.tinybutstrong.com/forum.php?msg_id=8310
* Now there is a TBS error message when [onload;block=...] doesn't found the block which is defined.
